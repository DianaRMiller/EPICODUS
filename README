This is my first code review project.

This project is about creating three web pages: one about myself index.html, the other about my dog Cuervo's favorite things
and the third page is about my dog Zoe.

This was a fun and challenging project; I found myself intrigued by this new language and I'm hoping to get better everyday!

Please take a look at my first of many projects at EPICODUS and I am excited about what this new adventure.
