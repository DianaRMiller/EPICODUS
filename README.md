## Description

_{This project was about creating three different web pages utilizing HTML and CSS. Using terminal to create files and the path to my project; initiate an cloned a repository, add/commit/raname/push/pull... files from my computer to the repository in "Github.com":
Thi is the link: "<a href=htts://github.com/DianaRMiller/EPICODUS"</a>. The first web page is about myself a brief description of me, an image that represents who am i, my background and current hobbies/skills:
<a href="index".html"</a>
My second page is about my dog Zoe and Lilu:
<a href="my-first-webpage.html"</a>
Finally my third page and is about my third four legged kid!

I learned the basics for building web pages using "atom" as my application to write HTML and CSS files; the use of the terminal and how to create a file with all my project documents and was able to have my project online through github and the support of EPICODUS! (Great programming school). Feedback is appreciated.}_
